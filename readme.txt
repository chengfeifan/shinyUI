IDVx        Directory containing data files from a simulation of the
            decentralized strategy with disturbance x of Downs and Vogel.
            The disturbance occurs at time = 1 hour and lasts for the
            remainder of the 50-hour simulation.  Variables are sampled
            every 10 minutes.  There are 4 data files, organized as follows:

   y.dat    ASCII (TEXT) file containing the measured outputs.  Each row
            represents a time instant, starting at time = 0.  Each column
            is a measured variable.  The first 41 are the XMEAS variables
            from the TE model (measured outputs).  Columns are delimited by
            TAB characters to make it easier to load the files into plotting
            and analysis packages (such as Matlab).  The remaining columns
            are as follows:

            (42) is for cost [cents/kmol product].
            (43) is production rate of G [kmol G generated/h]
            (44) is production rate of H [kmol H generated/h]
            (45) is production rate of F [kmol F generated/h]
            (46) is partial pressure of A in reactor [kPa]
            (47) is partial pressure of C in reactor [kPa]
            (48) is partial pressure of D in reactor [kPa]
            (49) is partial pressure of E in reactor [kPa]
            (50) is true (delay free) mole % G in product
            (51) is true (delay free) mole % H in product

            These "extra" outputs are not used in the control strategy.
            They may be useful in interpreting the results, however.

   u.dat    As for y, but containing the 12 manipulated variable signals
            (XMV) of the TE model.  All values are in the range 0-100 %.

   r.dat    As for y, but containing 36 variables used in the decentralized
            control strategy.  These include setpoints for the various loops
            as well as other signals.  They are probably not of general
            interest, but just in case, here's a description.

   t.dat    The first column gives the time instants corresponding to 
            each row in y, u and r.  The other 2 columns in t.dat are
            not of general interest and can be ignored.
